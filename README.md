# To-Do-List-Manager
# Overview

The software I developed is a To-Do List Manager written in C++. It leverages object-oriented programming features such as classes and objects to efficiently manage tasks. The system offers a menu-driven interface for users to interact with, enabling them to perform a variety of actions seamlessly.

Users can add tasks, remove tasks, view all tasks, mark tasks as completed, sort tasks by creation time, search for tasks by title, and save tasks to a file. Each task is represented by a struct containing relevant information like title, description, creation time, and completion status.

Throughout the development process, I aimed to demonstrate my understanding of C++ language syntax and concepts. By building a functional application, I aimed to showcase my proficiency in C++ programming and enhance my skills as a software developer student.

# Development Environment

To develop this software, I used the following tools:

- Visual Studio Code as my integrated development environment (IDE)
- The GCC compiler to compile and run my C++ code
- The C++ Standard Library for various utility functions and data structures
I wrote the software in C++ and utilized the following libraries:

- <iostream> for input/output operations
- <algorithm> Used for various algorithms like sorting and searching
- <string> for working with strings
- <vector> Employed for storing tasks in a vector data structure
- <ctime> Employed for working with time-related functions
- <fstream> Utilized for file input/output operations
